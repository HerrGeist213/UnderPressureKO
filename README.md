### The Design
---
**The Colors**<br>
Even though this was a code-along from Frontend Mentor that I was supposed to change the colors for, I decided to keep the original colors after choosing my Unsplash images. It just fit too perfectly to change anything in the pallette after I saw how well it all matched up.

**The Hamburger**<br>
The dropdown / hamburger menu was pretty simple, but I do enjoy putting them together during these projects to solidify my knowledge of this concept.

### The Content
---
**Goals & Users**<br>
I honestly messaged a friend and said "Give me the first thought that comes to your mind!", and then I developed the site around that idea. One thing I've always found unappealing about weighted blankets is the bland, hefty designs you see in most of them. I pretended that a technology exists that would attract people like me to the weighted blanket world who don't like the big, ungainly stuff that's available right now.

### The Build
---
This build was relatively easy, so I wanted to implement some of the things I learned during the course I recenly graduated from. I could really only think of implementing color variables since I already enjoyed the colors that were present for my design.
<br><br>

### Summary
---
I understand that this project may seem like it's a little lackluster, but I would have gone beyond just redesigning some icons and changing the text content if the weighted blanket idea did not fit so perfectly into the existing design. I still spent hours getting everything correct in Photoshop and coding everything out with the code-along, but I don't really have much else to say except that I REALLY enjoyed the in-depth look into Sass.
